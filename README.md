Tiny mockup of a ground station for a satellite mission running on a unix desktop or laptop computer. This system has been designe to be used in conjunction with a *tiny OBDH system*, preferrably running on an embedded computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi). Both computers
communicate through sockets on an internet connection.
